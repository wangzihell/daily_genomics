  - Stem solidness is an important agronomic trait of durum (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) and bread (Triticum aestivum L.) 实心小麦
  - copy numberdependent expression of TdDof could be directly or indirectly involved in the negative regulation of programmed cell death (PCD)

  - Diversity indices: Expected heterozygosity, inbreeding coefficient, Shannon diversity index
  - he (Expected heterozygosity): The index summarizes genetic variation and it reaches a 0.5 value for diploid loci when the allelic frequencies are equal to 0.5, maximum of diversity.
  - ho (Observed heterozygosity): the proportion of heterozygotes at locus ith, and it is averaged for the population characterization
  - inbreeding coefficient: compare he and ho
  - Shannon diversity index:

- [Genetic Contribution of Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank) to Heat Tolerance of Bread Wheat](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01529/full)
  - The materials were genotyped using a 90K SNP platform and these data were used to estimate the contribution of emmer wheat to the progeny.
  - Significant phenotypic and genetic variation for key agronomical traits was observed.

- [Genome plasticity a key factor in the success of polyploid wheat under domestication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737438/)
  - Polyploid wheat has been able to compensate for diversity bottlenecks caused by domestica- tion and polyploidy by capturing a relatively large proportion of the variability of its tetra- ploid wild progenitor. In addition, new variation is rapidly generated in the dynamic wheat ge- nomes through gene deletions and insertions of repetitive elements into coding and regu- latory gene regions. These mutations can then be expressed as quantitative gene dosage dif- ferences because of the polyploid nature of wheat. Synergy between the high mutation rates and the buffering effects of polyploidy makes it possible for polyploid wheat to capi- talize on the diversity generated by its dynamic genomes.

  - Genomic convergence happens at multiple genetic levels, which depends the existence of selective pressure at that level.

- [The genetic causes of convergent evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3483)
  - Convergent evolution result from the fact that mutations in some genetic targets minimize pleiotropic effects while simultaneously maximizing adaptation.

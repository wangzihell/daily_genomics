- [Copy number variation of TdDof controls solid-stemmed architecture in wheat](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/10/29/2009418117.short)
  - Stem solidness is an important agronomic trait of durum (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) and bread (Triticum aestivum L.) 实心小麦
  - copy numberdependent expression of TdDof could be directly or indirectly involved in the negative regulation of programmed cell death (PCD)

- [Diversity analysis of 80,000 wheat accessions reveals consequences and opportunities of selection footprints](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18404-w)
  - Diversity indices: Expected heterozygosity, inbreeding coefficient, Shannon diversity index
  - he (Expected heterozygosity): The index summarizes genetic variation and it reaches a 0.5 value for diploid loci when the allelic frequencies are equal to 0.5, maximum of diversity.
  - ho (Observed heterozygosity): the proportion of heterozygotes at locus ith, and it is averaged for the population characterization
  - inbreeding coefficient: compare he and ho
  - Shannon diversity index:

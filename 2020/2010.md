  - Historically, wheat breeding has reshuffled a limited palette of haplotypes; continued improvement will require selection at dozens of loci of diminishing effect, as most of the major loci we mapped are known.

  - Centromere boundary is determined by position of two species-specific sequence and centromere-specific markder ChIP-seq.
  - Many functional important phenotypes are controled by families of genes, like disease resistance, grain protein.
  - Function of gene is larged defined by its domain.

- [New insights into structural organization and gene duplication in a 1.75‐Mb genomic region harboring the α‐gliadin gene family in Aegilops tauschii, the source of wheat D genome](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.13675)
  - Both genome assemblies contained gaps, but often at different positions, and we were able to fill all 49 gaps with the hybrid assembly. 
  - Ae. tauschii not only provides genetic resources for useful traits for wheat improvement, but also contributes most to flour baking quality due to the unique features present in the D genome prolamins. They had gone through duplication and expansion. 
  - These α‐gliadin genes and nearby GLRs have different fates.

- [Structural variation and rates of genome evolution in the grass family seen through comparison of sequences of genomes greatly differing in size](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.13964)
  - Densities of collinear genes along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes were highly correlated with meiotic recombination rates but those of rearrangements were not, suggesting different causes of the erosion of gene collinearity and evolution of major chromosome rearrangements.
  - More than an order of magnitude faster rate of genomic change in the Triticeae genomes compared to the rice and sorghum genomes。
  - a comprehensive long-term evolutionary genomic changes study.

- [Structural Variations Affecting Genes and Transposable Elements of Chromosome 3B in Wheats](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00891/full)
  - The rate of structral variation: one could expect roughly 29,000 new TE insertions since the hexaploidization, 10,000 years ago and 1,500 new TEs inserted in CS since it diverged. CS diverge 500 years ago ?
  - Both dendrograms defined the same eight monophyletic groups corresponding to the seven Triticum species of our panel with T. aestivum split into two groups: East-Asian accessions (China and Japan) vs all other accessions.

  - The DNA sequences of plant centromeres usually contain many copies of simple tandem repeats, interrupted by long-terminal repeat retrotransposons.
  - two types of functional centromeric satellites that are abundant in two of the three subgenomes. (B and D). These centromeric satellites had unit sizes greater than 500 bp and contained specific sites with highly phased binding to CENH3 nucleosomes.
  - several T. aestivum centromeres lack satellite repeats. 
  - CentT566 Polymorphisms Related to CENH3 Binding Appeared during Hexaploid Wheat Evolution
  - Centromeric sequences were mainly retained, but some changes also occurred, from the progenitor of DD and wild emmer (AABB) to hexaploid wheat.

  - How could genomic help in agronomy?
  - Local adaptation is controled by a complex genetic regulation network, while some important agronomic phenotype could be adjusted throught editing few genes.
  - The “local optimum” crops should be mainstream worldwide in the future.

- [Crop genomes and beyond](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0691-5%5d)
  - How could genomic help in agronomy?
  - New technologies have been developed for assembling haplotype-resolved sequences from polyploid genomes.
  - Genome-editing tools have been utilized in crop species to target desired genes and improve agricultural traits. 
  - Crop pan-genomes have improved the understanding of genome structural variations within the genus and will potentially revolutionize the future directions of crop genomic studies.
  - The fundamental objective of crop science is to improve the performance of crops.

- [Worldwide phylogeography and history of wheat genetic diversity](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/5/eaav0536)
  - The Asian germplasm represents a significant fraction of the worldwide diversity that remains largely unexploited.
  - However, while these large blocks can be easily detected, smaller alien segments, referred to “cryptic introgressions,” are more difficult to identify (24). Therefore, it is likely that the total amount of alien DNA present in the current wheat germplasm is by far greater than that.
  - It is now widely admitted that, because of intraspecific SVs, a single individual genome is not sufficient to accurately describe the whole species.

- [Limited haplotype diversity underlies polygenic trait architecture across 70 years of wheat breeding](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.296533v1.full)
  - Historically, wheat breeding has reshuffled a limited palette of haplotypes; continued improvement will require selection at dozens of loci of diminishing effect, as most of the major loci we mapped are known.
  
- [Genomes of the Banyan Tree and Pollinator Wasp Provide Insights into Fig-Wasp Coevolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031240X)
  - the hierachical genetic bases of phenotype regulation: genome variation (karotype, structure), key genes variation (PAV, family fluctuation, mutation), expression pattern, epigenetic.
  - artifical population is superiority of plant research. 
  - recombination is key of species subdivison and difficiation, genetic map is reliable way to evaluate it.

- [1RS.1BL molecular resolution provides novel contributions to wheat improvement](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.14.295733v1.full)
  - Centromere boundary is determined by position of two species-specific sequence and centromere-specific markder ChIP-seq.
  - Many functional important phenotypes are controled by families of genes, like disease resistance, grain protein.
  - Function of gene is larged defined by its domain.

- [New insights into structural organization and gene duplication in a 1.75‐Mb genomic region harboring the α‐gliadin gene family in Aegilops tauschii, the source of wheat D genome](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.13675)
  - Both genome assemblies contained gaps, but often at different positions, and we were able to fill all 49 gaps with the hybrid assembly. 
  - Ae. tauschii not only provides genetic resources for useful traits for wheat improvement, but also contributes most to flour baking quality due to the unique features present in the D genome prolamins. They had gone through duplication and expansion. 
  - These α‐gliadin genes and nearby GLRs have different fates.

- [Structural variation and rates of genome evolution in the grass family seen through comparison of sequences of genomes greatly differing in size](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tpj.13964)
  - Densities of collinear genes along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes were highly correlated with meiotic recombination rates but those of rearrangements were not, suggesting different causes of the erosion of gene collinearity and evolution of major chromosome rearrangements.
  - More than an order of magnitude faster rate of genomic change in the Triticeae genomes compared to the rice and sorghum genomes。
  - a comprehensive long-term evolutionary genomic changes study.

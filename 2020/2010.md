- [The improved assembly of 7DL chromosome provides insight into the structure and evolution of bread wheat](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.13240)
  - BAC library sequencing is still a useful approach in genome assembly and gap closing.
  - the robust and straightforward way to selection status: dN/dS ratio.

- [Limited haplotype diversity underlies polygenic trait architecture across 70 years of wheat breeding](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.296533v1.full)
  - Historically, wheat breeding has reshuffled a limited palette of haplotypes; continued improvement will require selection at dozens of loci of diminishing effect, as most of the major loci we mapped are known.
  
- [Genomes of the Banyan Tree and Pollinator Wasp Provide Insights into Fig-Wasp Coevolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742031240X)
  - the hierachical genetic bases of phenotype regulation: genome variation (karotype, structure), key genes variation (PAV, family fluctuation, mutation), expression pattern, epigenetic.
  - artifical population is superiority of plant research. 
  - recombination is key of species subdivison and difficiation, genetic map is reliable way to evaluate it.
